- **Overall Status: on-schedule**
- **Number of hours worked this week: 13**
- **Total number of hours worked on the project thus far: 36**

- **Accomplishments: Confirmed will use the FLASK version of a CRUD APP. I have been able to build a rough foundation for the APP and am in the process of connecting it to the website for use.**
- **Challenges: Had a hard time building the CRUD APP and finding out if it would work with FLASK and even understanding how to connect the app to update the website as a seperate entity.**
- **Plans / Goals for next week: Finish connecting the CRUD APP completely and hopfully start adding finer details to it.**
- **SPED Talk Insight: I thought it was intresting I like video games as most young men, but I was not sure what Matthew's project was and how OpenGL ties into his project. I like to make 3D game maps for Bannerlord II in my freetime so it was quite intresting to me.**
